# php-github-dependency

An example usage of composer with github repo as dependency source

## Getting Started

Clone this repo then run a composer install

```
composer install
```

After that the composer will clone [php-calculator](https://github.com/titipat/php-calculator) and put it in `/vendor` directory. Finally use it as what your want like other composer dependency.

## Remark

* A dependency repo should has version tagged.
